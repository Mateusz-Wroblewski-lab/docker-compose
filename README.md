<h3>Hi, I am Mateusz.</h3>

<p>I am a computer graphic designer.
I worked in post-production
<br>and visual effects department for several years.
<br><br>I associate my future with the IT area - operating and servicing servers.
<br>As a hobby, I run my small home server lab. 
<br>I use Unraid OS amd Ubuntu. 
<br>I am learning how to operate applications
<br>using Docker technology with the command line. 
<br><br>Currently, I take care of the applications such as Nextcloud, 
<br>through reverse proxy Traefik and SWAG.
<br><br>In future I will learn Kubernetes technology.</p>
